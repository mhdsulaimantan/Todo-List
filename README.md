# Todo-list

### Description:
This is a simple todo-list website that allows users to add their tasks and organize their life. This is a solution for the [Odin project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list). The project was built using JavaScript and webpack(javascript bundler).

### How it works:
The program have two main sectors: **Todos** - **Projects**.

#### 1. Todos:
- The users can create a new todo, update an already existing one, read or view and delete it.

- When creating a new todo, it contains different information:
    <table>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Title</b></td>
    <td>The todo title</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Project Name</b></td>
    <td>the project name related to the todo</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Title</b></td>
    <td>The todo title</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
    <td>A little description for the purpose of the task</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Note</b></td>
    <td>Note for the task </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Date</b></td>
    <td>The date to do the task</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Proirity</b></td>
    <td>The importance level to do the task. <b>High</b> - <b>Normal</b> - <b>Low</b></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

- When the user finishes the task, they can mark the todo as done.
- Users can display all their todos using a different types of sorting options: 
  - by Todo **Date**.
  - by **Priority** level of the Todo.
  - by **Done** Todos.

#### 2. Projects:
The user can create new projects, update existing once, view the tasks or todos for this project and delete it.
